## Feedback

- Either elaborate on stuff or don't use "stuff / things"
- If they ask if you use AWS
  - Use the lingo, technical terms, the tools I would use S3 to dump, lambda
  - Limited experience - have built dashboard, report builder, excited to learn more
- If you can give an example for any answer - it's best to do that to demonstrate understanding of technical concepts
- Hypothetical - interacting with the stakeholders - consult with the stakeholders and understand the business needs throughout process
- Make sure the personality comes out
